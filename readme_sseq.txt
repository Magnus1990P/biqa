This is a demonstration of the Spatial¨CSpectral Entropy-based Quality (SSEQ) index. The algorithm is described in:

Lixiong Liu, Bao Liu, Hua Huang, and Alan Conrad Bovik. No-reference Image Quality Assessment Based on Spatial and Spectral Entropies, 
Signal Processing: Image Communication, 29(8), 2014. 856-863.

You can change this program as you like and use it anywhere, but please
refer to its original source (cite our paper and our web page at
http://live.ece.utexas.edu/research/quality/SSEQ_release.zip, 2014).

Running on Matlab 

Input : A test image loaded in an array

Output: A quality score of the image. The score typically has a value
        between 0 and 100 (0 represents the best quality, 100 the worst).
  
Usage:

%1. Load the image, for example
    image        = imread('bikes.bmp');

%2. Call this function to calculate the quality score:
    qualityscore = SSEQ(image)

Dependencies: 

LibSVM package: 
    C.C. Chang, C.J. Lin. LIBSVM: a library for support vector machines. Available from: 
    ¡´http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/¡µ, 2001.
